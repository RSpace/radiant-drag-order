= Drag Order v0.2.1

Created by Bright 4, February 2009. Inspired by and based on Sean Cribbs' Reorder extension.

This extension allows pages to be moved to any arbitrary (valid) place in the document tree structure by dragging the page to its new position and dropping it there.
The admin UI is extended with a small drag-button for each page.

The drag-and-drop style was inspired by the way OS-X implements this in various screens.


== Installation

1) Unpack/checkout/export the extension into vendor/extensions of your project.

2) Run the extension migrations (replace {environment} by the target environment, e.g. production).
   $ rake {environment} radiant:extensions:drag_order:migrate

3) Run the extension update task.
   $ rake {environment} radiant:extensions:drag_order:update

4) Restart the server and you're ready to drag-and-drop pages.
   To bypass the ordering system simply supply a "by" option to the finder tags.


== Usage

- Click and hold the drag-button of the page you wish to move. If the page has children and is expanded, this page will collapse (because a page cannot be placed in between its descendants).
- Drag the page to its new position. The purple bar shows the new location and indentation of the page.
- If, while dragging, you hold the cursor above a page with collapsed children, this page will expand after one second.
- If you want to place the page you are dragging as the child of a page which does not have any children yet, you can either press-and-hold Ctrl or Command or make sure the mouse cursor is located to the right of the drag-button.
- If the page has been dragged to the correct location, release the mouse cursor. The admin page will reload with the page at its new position.


== Notes

- Requires Javascript
- *** DOES NOT WORK IN (all versions of) SAFARI 2 ***
  This is due to the fact that Radiants' own JS files do not work correctly under Safari 2
